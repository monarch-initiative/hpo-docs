The GA4GH Phenopacket schema consists of several optional elements, each of which contains information about a certain topic, such as phenotype, variant, or pedigree. An element can contain other elements, which allows a hierarchical representation of data. For instance, Phenopacket contains elements of type Individual, PhenotypicFeature, Biosample, and so on.

The annotations can have modifiers that describe the age of onset and the frequencies of features.

The annotations include phenotypic abnormalities that are never present in a disease, and their absence can be leveraged in the differential diagnosis of diseases with overlapping clinical features. For instance, Ectopia lentis is not a characteristic of Loeys-Dietz syndrome 1 , whereas it is frequently observed in subjects with Marfan syndrome .
